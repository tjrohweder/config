# Personal Configuration Files

This repository contains configuration files I use to customize my personal development environment. It includes settings for my shell and editor preferences. While mainly for personal use, feel free to explore or adapt anything you find useful.

## Contents

- `.zshrc` – Zsh shell configuration (aliases, functions, environment variables).
- `zed/` – Configuration directory for the [Zed editor](https://zed.dev), including themes, keybindings, and settings.

## How to Use

Clone the repository and symlink the files you want:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/configs.git
ln -s ~/configs/.zshrc ~/.zshrc
